# hello-world
Of the many I am one.

2012 DeVry graduate in Computer Information Systems with specialization in Information Security. Recently unemployed after 30 years in the airline industry due to Covid-19. Looking to gain proficiency in order to gain employment in IT. In my spare time I enjoy travelling, gaming, and keeping up with the latest in the tech world.
